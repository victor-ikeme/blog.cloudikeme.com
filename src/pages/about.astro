    <strong>Build Platforms Daily</strong> is more than just a blog — it’s a space where real-world platform engineering meets product thinking.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m <strong>Victor Ikeme</strong>, a Cloud Platform Engineer with a deep focus on developer experience and platform adoption. I believe internal platforms should be treated like products — with clear goals, thoughtful design, and relentless focus on customer (developer) needs.
  </p>

  <h2>Why This Blog Exists</h2>
  <p>
    Most organizations are under pressure to move fast and scale efficiently. But developers often face fragmented, inconsistent tooling that slows them down. The solution? Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) — when done right.
  </p>
  <p>
    This blog is where I document the systems, patterns, and decisions that go into building scalable, useful, and lovable IDPs. From Kubernetes and CI/CD pipelines to documentation, governance, and user onboarding — nothing is off the table.
  </p>

  <h2>What You’ll Find Here</h2>

  </p>

  <h2>Who It’s For</h2>
  <p>
    Whether you're a platform engineer, DevOps practitioner, staff engineer, or team lead tasked with improving developer workflows — you're in the right place.
  </p>

  <h2>Let’s Build Together</h2>
  <p>
    Platform engineering is still evolving — and the best solutions come from shared knowledge. This blog is my contribution to that conversation. I’d love for you to be part of it.
